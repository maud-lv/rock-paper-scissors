# rock-paper-scissors

This is the famous rock paper scissors game!

First, I watched a video from FreeCodeCamp, explaining how to create a very basic version of that game, and I improved it by changing some of the texts, displaying the input from the computer for a better user experience and adding a prompt to restart the game as long as the user wants to keep playing.

In a next version, I would like to add the well, which is an option I used to play with, when I was younger. The well wins over the scissors and the rock as both fall into the well, but is beaten by the paper that covers the well.

To continue, I might look into making a user interface.
It would be good to ask the user if they want to play with the version including the well or not. For me that version is closer to what I played in my childhood, but it's not the case for all. It could be nice to add other features too.

And why not create another game using similar tactics and inspired by Pokemons?
